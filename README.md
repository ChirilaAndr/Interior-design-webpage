# Interior-design-webpage
A one page webpage designer after a w3schools template.

This is one of my first projects so the code is not perfect. Might refactor later.

I used:
- vanilla JS, floats and grid-like system (similar to bootstrap);

Challenges:
- making it responsive
- changing the left side menu to a header on smaller screens
- hamburger menu
- expanding photos when clicked
