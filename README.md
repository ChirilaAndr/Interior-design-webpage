# Interior-design-webpage
A one page webpage designer after a w3schools template - https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/tryw3css_templates_interior_design.htm#
I tried copying the template as much as possible. 

This is one of my first projects so the code is not perfect.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
- Expand photos
- Use navigation menu on desktop & mobile

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla JavaScript
