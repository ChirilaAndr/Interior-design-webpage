# Interior-design-webpage
A one page webpage designer after a w3schools template - https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/tryw3css_templates_interior_design.htm#
I tried copying the template as much as possible. 

This is one of my first projects so the code is not perfect. Might refactor later.

I used:
- vanilla JS, floats and grid-like system (similar to bootstrap);

Challenges:
- making it responsive
- changing the left side menu to a header on smaller screens
- hamburger menu
- expanding photos when clicked
